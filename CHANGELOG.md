## Unreleased

## 1.2.1

- Fix: a blank filter value (`nil` / `""` / `[]`) no longer activates its filter. 1.2.0 activated a filter whenever its param key was present, so an empty value produced conditions like `WHERE col = ''` — harmless on some string columns, but a 500 (`PG::InvalidTextRepresentation`) on integer/uuid columns and unintended narrowing (`WHERE col IN ()`) elsewhere. Blank values are now skipped again (pre-1.2 behavior). A literal boolean `false` is still treated as an active value, preserving the #58 fix.

## 1.2.0

### Breaking changes:
- Drop support for Ruby 2.7, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 (all end-of-life); require Ruby `>= 3.3`
- Drop support for Rails 7.0 and 7.1 (end-of-life); require `activerecord >= 7.2`
- CI test matrix now covers Ruby 3.3–3.4 against Rails 7.2 and 8.0

## 1.1.0

- Add support for Rails 7.1, 7.2, and 8.0 (#67)
- Migrate CI from Travis to GitHub Actions; test matrix covers Ruby 2.7–3.3 against Rails 7.0–8.0 (#67)
- Add `allow_nil: true` option to `filter_on` to enable `IS NULL` filtering for non-JSONB column types (#84)
- Add support for date range filtering on JSONB keys, using the same `...` range format as other filters (#83)
- Fix boolean filter being silently skipped when the value is `false` (#58). Note: filters with empty-string values are now applied (previously skipped); review consumers if you relied on the old behavior.
- Fix `NameError` in JSONB filtering when value is an Array (#56)
